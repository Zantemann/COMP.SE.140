Findings on Container and Host Sharing

Each container has its own unique IP address within the Docker network, separate from the host's IP.
They run isolated sets of processes, and their disk space usage is also independent of the host.
The uptime of each container is specific to that container and does not depend on the host's uptime.

The containers are connected via a Docker bridge network called compse140_default, allowing them to communicate with each other.
Service1 is accessible from the host on port 8199, making it reachable externally at localhost:8199.

In summary, the containers share the network bridge for internal communication and use port mapping for external access to Service1.
However, they do not share process space, file systems, or uptime information with the host, ensuring independent operation while maintaining necessary connectivity.
